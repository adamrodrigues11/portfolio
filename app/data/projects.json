The application allows an analyst to group customers into custom segments based on their demographics or transaction records in order to generate targeted comparisons and marketing insights. My main responsibilities included leading the design and implementation of the segment details page (both the UI and associated API endpoints), and contributing to the design of the overall application architecture."
